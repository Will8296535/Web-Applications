jQuery and JSON based Text Editor<br>
Language: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP. System: Windows<br>
This is an online text editor. The client page will allow user to choose a text file from a list, open it, and populate and editable area on the page. The user can make simple text edits in the text edit area and save the text to the same file or a new file on the server. This app uses jQuery to make an AJAX call to populate the file list and editable text area on the web page. The data interchange is using JSON format.<br>
